# Notes

- Hello visitors, these are the notes I have been taking recently, here I  will share with all of you. 

- This is a working process, therefore nothing is finished! If you want to collaborate just send me a message and we can arrange a branch for you.

- The resources I have used / I am using for these notes as of 15-3-2018 are these:
    1. HTML: For HTML im following the MDN tutorials, as you would see if you read them, I have not deviated much from their content. I plan on also starting a glossary soon. 
    2. CS : For computer science and logic I am following the curriculum of [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). I am taking these real slowly as it uses academic sources and can be slightly cryptic at times.
    3. PHP: PHP notes follow the introductory PHP / SQL tutorial from openclassrooms, however I am considering changing source as it is often not specific enough and therefore doesn't suit my goals with these notes.
    4. CSS: *To be started*
    5. JS: *To be started*

- Thank you and feel free to send me a message, this repo will be updated daily therefore your contribution is very appreciated!
